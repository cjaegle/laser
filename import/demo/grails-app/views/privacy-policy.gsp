As a result of those actions, you might supply us with such information as: your name; institution name, job title, postal addresses, telephone number, fax number and email address; invoicing information; payment details; people (with postal and email addresses, phone numbers and fax numbers) listed in Your membership account settings; content of reviews and emails to us; and financial information.</p>

We may also use browser data such as cookies, Flash cookies (also known as Flash Local Shared Objects), or similar data on certain parts of our website for fraud prevention and other purposes. During some visits we may use software tools such as JavaScript to measure and collect session information, including page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse overs), and methods used to browse away from the page.</p>
