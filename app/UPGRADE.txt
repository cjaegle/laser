This version has changed the structure of user_org table. SQL update needed to convert the old text based role names into
role table FK links.

mysql> update user_org set formal_role_id = 4 where formal_role_id is NULL and role = 'Admin';
mysql> update user_org set formal_role_id = 5 where formal_role_id is NULL and role = 'Staff';
