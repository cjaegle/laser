This version has changed the structure of user_org table. SQL update needed to convert the old text based role names into
role table FK links.

mysql> update user_org set formal_role_id = 4 where formal_role_id is NULL and role = 'Admin';
mysql> update user_org set formal_role_id = 5 where formal_role_id is NULL and role = 'Staff';


This changes all members of NESLI2 to JC
 update combo set combo_to_org_fk = 35 where  combo_to_org_fk = 7 and combo_type_rv_fk = 83;


<<<<<<< HEAD
ToDo: We need to change other NESLI2 links to JC - eg consortial links on licenses, subscriptions...
=======
Make JC appear in list of orgs users can request membership of
update org set sector = 'Higher Education' where org_shortcode = 'JISC_Collections'
