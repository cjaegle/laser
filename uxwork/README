# KB+ Site Licenses

## Files / Folders

- build : Folder containing very small build script to combine the files of the plugins folder and push them through JSMin.
- libs : Git submodule from Twitter Bootstrap
- site : The actually HTML markup with imagery and stylesheets.

## Information

We've expanded on the Twitter bootstrap originally used and restyled it for the given design. There are four seperate
stylesheets in use in the site folder. The first two are just the standard bootstrap and bootstrap responsive sheets. These have not be 
edited directly. The additional two sheets can be found in the css folder. The first is bootstrap.css which contains styles that
overwrite the bootstrap classes for the purposes of the updated design. The second, style.css, are custom classes.

All the plugins in use can be found in js/plugins and are then combined into plugins.js and minified into plugins.min.js.

jQuery 1.7.1 has been used during development and is pulled in from the Google Code library and then falls back onto a local copy
of the library if that request isn't fulfilled. 

If the folder structure is changed then the stylesheet image paths will require updating as they current reference the images folder
as such: url('../img/image.png');

Each of the template files have a comment that starts with COMBINE and further down the page is a comment with COMINE END. The content
between these two tags can be copied and pasted if it is decided the details, documents, links and notes are to be contained in a single
file for the purpose of the bootstraps tabs JS plugin.

There are a number of lightbox 'modals' for simple popup forms. Modals can be found just after the footer in the markup files.

There is a number of small pieces of JS that are used on each page that involve such actions as toggling options when checkboxes and
radio boxes are selected.
